# Quanergy Sensor SDK
This SDK serves as sample code for connecting to Quanergy sensors. The QuanergyClient library consumes raw data from any Quanergy sensor, provides some utility functions, and produces PCL PointClouds for further processing. This repository also includes two example apps:
- visualizer - uses the QuanergyClient library and PCL Visualization to render the point cloud
- dynamic_connection - shows how the QuanergyClient library can be used to dynamically connect/disconnect/reconnect to sensors
